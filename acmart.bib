  abstract={Following the development of decentralized generation and smart appliances, energy communities have become a phenomenon of increased interest. While the benefits of such communities have been discussed, there is increasing concern that inadequate grid tariffs may lead to excess adoption of such business models. Furthermore, snowball effects may be observed following the effects these communities have on grid tariffs. We show that restraining the study to a simple cost-benefit analysis is far from satisfactory. Therefore, we use the framework of cooperative game theory to take account of the ability of communities to share gains between members. The interaction between energy communities and the DSO then results in a non-cooperative equilibrium. We provide mathematical formulations and intuitions of such effects, and carry out realistic numerical applications where communities can invest jointly in solar panels and batteries. We show that such a snowball effect may be observed, but its magnitude and its welfare effects will depend on the grid tariff structure that is implemented, leading to possible PV over-investments.},

While the potential benefits have been described, we use the framework of cooperative game theory to test the ability of such communities to adequately share the gains. Indeed, despite the potential value created by such coalitions, there is no guarantee that they will be viable: a subset of participants may find it profitable to exit the community and create another one of their own. We take the case of a neighborhood, having access to a limited resource e.g. a shared roof or piece of land which they can exploit if they invest in some renewable production capacity. By joining the community, participants also enjoy aggregation gains in the form of reduced network fees. We find conditions depending on the structure of renewable installation costs, on the magnitude of the aggregation effect and coordination costs and, most importantly, on the chosen sharing rule, under which the whole energy community is stable. Efficiency could require the intervention of a social planner or a change in network tariff structures.},

abstract = {Information and communications technologies (ICTs) have enabled the rise of so-called “Collaborative Consumption” (CC): the peer-to-peer-based activity of obtaining, giving, or sharing the access to goods and services, coordinated through community-based online services. CC has been expected to alleviate societal problems such as hyper-consumption, pollution, and poverty by lowering the cost of economic coordination within communities. However, beyond anecdotal evidence, there is a dearth of understanding why people participate in CC. Therefore, in this article we investigate people's motivations to participate in CC. The study employs survey data (N = 168) gathered from people registered onto a CC site. The results show that participation in CC is motivated by many factors such as its sustainability, enjoyment of the activity as well as economic gains. An interesting detail in the result is that sustainability is not directly associated with participation unless it is at the same time also associated with positive attitudes towards CC. This suggests that sustainability might only be an important factor for those people for whom ecological consumption is important. Furthermore, the results suggest that in CC an attitude-behavior gap might exist; people perceive the activity positively and say good things about it, but this good attitude does not necessary translate into action.},

pages={533-539}, 
abstract={Future electricity distribution grids will host a considerable share of variable renewable energy sources and local storage resources. Moreover, they will face new load structures due for example to the growth of the electric vehicle market. These trends raise the need for new paradigms for distribution grids operation, in which Distribution System Operators will increasingly rely on demand side flexibility and households will progressively become prosumers playing an active role on smart grid energy management. However, in present energy management architectures, the lack of coordination among actors limits the capability of the grid to enable the mentioned trends. In this paper we tackle this problem by proposing an architecture that enables households to autonomously exchange energy blocks and flexibility services with neighbors, operators and market actors. The solution is based on a blockchain transactive platform. We focus on a market application, where households can trade energy with their neighbors, aimed to locally balancing renewable energy production. We propose a market mechanism and dynamic transport prices that provide an incentive for households to locally manage energy resources in a way that responds to both prosumer and operator needs. We evaluate the impact of such markets through comprehensive simulations using power flow analysis and realistic load profiles, providing valuable insight for the design of appropriate mechanisms and incentives.},

abstract={Sharing economy is a transformative socio-economic phenomenon built around the idea of sharing underused resources and services, e.g. transportation and housing, thereby reducing costs and extracting value. Anticipating continued reduction in the cost of electricity storage, we look into the potential opportunity in electrical power system where consumers share storage with each other. We consider two different scenarios. In the first scenario, consumers are assumed to already have individual storage devices and they explore cooperation to minimize the realized electricity consumption cost. In the second scenario, a group of consumers is interested to invest in joint storage capacity and operate it cooperatively. The resulting system problems are modeled using cooperative game theory. In both cases, the cooperative games are shown to have non-empty cores and we develop efficient cost allocations in the core with analytical expressions. Thus, sharing of storage in cooperative manner is shown to be very effective for the electric power system.},

abstract={We consider using a battery storage system simultaneously for peak shaving and frequency regulation through a joint optimization framework, which captures battery degradation, operational constraints, and uncertainties in customer load and regulation signals. Under this framework, using real data we show the electricity bill of users can be reduced by up to 12\%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the saving from joint optimization is often larger than the sum of the optimal savings when the battery is used for the two individual applications. A simple threshold real-time algorithm is proposed and achieves this superlinear gain. Compared to prior works that focused on using battery storage systems for single applications, our results suggest that batteries can achieve much larger economic benefits than previously thought if they jointly provide multiple services.},

abstract={The Ontario electrical grid is sized to meet peak electricity load. If this worst-case load were reduced, the government and Ontario tax-(payers could defer large infrastructural costs, reducing the cost of generation and electricity prices. Storage, batteries that can store energy during times of low load and be discharged during times of peak load, is one proposed solution to reducing peak load. We evaluate the effect of storage on the electrical grid under different customer electricity pricing schemes. We find that for existing pricing schemes, adopting storage is not profitable. Furthermore, r as the level of storage adoption in the population increases, pricing schemes that incentivize charging at times known to all homeowners will eventually increase the peak load rather than decrease it. However, in some circumstances particular levels of homeowner i storage adoption helps the grid reduce peak load, and thus the grid t may choose to subsidize the cost of storage. We discuss hypothetical pricing schemes under which storage adoption is profitable for homeowners.},

abstract={End users equipped with storage may exploit time variations in electricity prices to earn profit by doing energy arbitrage, i.e., buying energy when it is cheap and selling it when it is expensive. We propose an algorithm to find an optimal solution of the energy arbitrage problem under given time varying electricity prices. Our algorithm is based on discretization of optimal Lagrange multipliers of a convex problem and has a structure in which the optimal control decisions are independent of past or future prices beyond a certain time horizon. The proposed algorithm has a run time complexity of O(N2) in the worst case, where N denotes the time horizon. To show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, we compare its runtime performance with other algorithms used in MATLAB's constrained optimization solvers. Our algorithm is found to be at least ten times faster, and hence has the potential to be used for in real-time. Using the proposed algorithm, we also evaluate the benefits of doing energy arbitrage over an extended period of time for which price signals are available from some ISO's in USA and Europe.},

Neumann and Morgenstern (1944) presented the first general model and solution concept for the multiperson cooperative theory. Stable set theory is viewed as only one of several approaches for analyzing coalitional games. This chapter focuses on the von Neumann-Morgenstern stable sets, describes their original model for the coalitional games along with some illustrations, analyzes the three-person case in detail, and discusses some of the mathematical properties of stable sets. Stable sets are defined in terms of two simple conditions: internal and external stability; along with a rather simple preference relation called “domination.” These stability concepts are rather basic and fundamental mathematical notions, and presume very little about the nature or structure of social institutions and interactions. Stable sets often predict likely social structures and how groups will organize themselves. They show the important role of minimal winning coalitions and minimal-sized veto (or blocking) coalitions. They often show how a game will decompose into subgames between critical coalitions. They exhibit a variety of standards of behavior and delineate bargaining ranges. They predict the formation of cartels and illustrate the stability of discrimination and its limits. Few assumptions can lead to many insights into coalition formation, competition, and distributions of wealth. There are also many situations where stable set theory matches well with experimental results. The chapter also discusses some highly undesirable properties of stable set theories."

  abstract  = {ABSTRACTDespite the rapid uptake of small-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in recent years, public availability of generation and load data at the household level remains very limited. Moreover, such data are typically measured using bi-directional meters recording only PV generation in excess of residential load rather than recording generation and load separately. In this paper, we report a publicly available dataset consisting of load and rooftop PV generation for 300 de-identified residential customers in an Australian distribution network, with load centres covering metropolitan Sydney and surrounding regional areas. The dataset spans a 3-year period, with separately reported measurements of load and PV generation at 30-min intervals. Following a detailed description of the dataset, we identify several means by which anomalous records (e.g. due to inverter failure) are identified and excised. With the resulting ‘clean’ dataset, we identify key customer-specific and aggregated characteristics of rooftop PV generation and residential load.},

The objective function of the model is to minimize the total cost associated with solar power system investments and the grid provided electric power over a planning horizon. We consider the uncertainty associated with solar radiation, load, and electricity price in the form of probabilistic scenarios. The model can be used with different grid pricing programs and under no net metering or net metering programs, respectively. A numerical example and its parametric analyses are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the model and develop some insights into optimal sizing of a battery storage enabled solar system. The analyses show the size of the solar system is influenced by the labor cost and the load size whereas the size of the battery storage is sensitive to the load size and the battery cost. Moreover, we find the optimal number of solar panels/batteries is larger under the net metering program than under no net metering program."

We have reviewed the literature on historical development of models for PV-battery systems sizing. A multi-period mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is then introduced with the objective of maximizing the net present value of cash flow (for investment analysis) or the savings in electricity bill (for operation scheduling). For investment decision analysis, the model is capable to identify whether it is economical to invest in PV and/or battery systems, and if positive it can find the best PV and/or battery systems from the mix of available options. Furthermore, the model defines the optimal size of selected PV and/or battery systems. The model will select one or a combination of a few systems if feasible. All these decision variables are identified concurrently with finding the optimal operation schedule of the PV and/or battery systems at each period over the planning horizon. These variables include power flows of grid-to-load, PV-to-load, battery-to-load, battery-to-grid, grid-to-battery, PV-to-battery, PV-to-grid as well as battery state-of charge. This decision support program enables the consumer (ranging from a small house to large-scale industrial plants) to implement the most efficient electricity management strategy while achieving the goal of minimizing the electricity bill."

We then show that an optimality interval consists either of a breakpoint or the open interval between two consecutive breakpoints of the continuous piecewise linear convex function ϑ($\lambda$). As a consequence, the optimality intervals form a partition of the closed interval {\{}$\lambda$; {\textbrokenbar}ϑ($\lambda$){\textbrokenbar} < ∞{\}}. Based on these optimality intervals, we also introduce an algorithm for solving the parametric RHS LP problem which requires an LP solver as a subroutine. If a polynomial-time LP solver is used to implement this subroutine, we obtain a substantial improvement on the complexity of those parametric RHS LP instances which exhibit degeneracy. When the number of breakpoints of ϑ($\lambda$) is polynomial in terms of the size of the parametric problem, we show that the latter can be solved in polynomial time.",

Cooperating players not only face a joint optimisation problem in trying, e.g., to minimise total joint costs, but also face an additional allocation problem in how to distribute these joint costs back to the individual players. This interplay between optimisation and allocation is the main subject of the area of operations research games. It is surveyed on the basis of a distinction between the nature of the underlying optimisation problem: connection, routing, scheduling, production and inventory.",

    abstract = { In the context of multistage stochastic optimization problems, we propose a hybrid strategy for generalizing to nonlinear decision rules, using machine learning, a finite data set of constrained vector-valued recourse decisions optimized using scenario-tree techniques from multistage stochastic programming. The decision rules are based on a statistical model inferred from a given scenario-tree solution and are selected by out-of-sample simulation given the true problem. Because the learned rules depend on the given scenario tree, we repeat the procedure for a large number of randomly generated scenario trees and then select the best solution (policy) found for the true problem. The scheme leads to an ex post selection of the scenario tree itself. Numerical tests evaluate the dependence of the approach on the machine learning aspects and show cases where one can obtain near-optimal solutions, starting with a “weak” scenario-tree generator that randomizes the branching structure of the trees. }

This formulation considers ramping and capacity constraints, charging and discharging efficiency losses of the storage, inelastic consumer load and local renewable generation in presence of net-metering which facilitates selling of energy to the grid and incentivizes consumers to install renewable generation and energy storage. We consider the case where the consumer loads, electricity prices, and renewable generations at different instances are uncertain. These uncertain quantities are predicted using an Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) model and used in a model predictive control (MPC) framework to obtain the arbitrage decision at each instance.

The optimal use of such storage when facing Time of Use (ToU) prices is directly related to the quality of the load and generation forecasts as well as the algorithm that controls the battery. The sensitivity of such control to different forecast techniques is studied in this paper. It is shown that good and bad forecasts can result in losses in, particularly bad days. Nevertheless, it is observed that performing Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a simple forecast that is representative of the pasts can be profitable under different price and battery scenarios. We observe that performing MPC at a faster sampling time with a receding optimization horizon makes arbitrage less sensitive to uncertainties in forecasting. We use real data from Pecan Street and ToU price levels with different buying and selling price for the numerical experiments.},  keywords={distributed power generation;energy storage;load forecasting;optimisation;power generation control;power generation economics;power generation planning;power markets;power supply quality;predictive control;pricing;solar cell arrays;energy storage arbitrage;residential consumers;photovoltaic panels;ToU;battery;forecast techniques;model predictive control;MPC;sampling time;receding optimization horizon;generation forecast error;time of use prices;power quality;load forecast;pecan street;distributed energy resources massive deployment;Batteries;Mathematical model;Predictive control;Optimization;Forecasting;Sensitivity;Sensitivity;Arbitrage;Smart Grids;Battery;Load Forecast;Model Predictive Control},  doi={10.1109/SmartGridComm.2019.8909733},  ISSN={},  month={Oct},}
